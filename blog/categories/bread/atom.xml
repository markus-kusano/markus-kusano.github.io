    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All my posts have been very serious. Here is some easy to read documentation of
my experience baking free wild yeast bread.</p>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve baked bread with commercial yeast, which are the little brown
balls that you dissolve in water to create bubbles. I usually used a fairly
good amount of yeast so that the rise times were quick (a few hours).</p>

<p>I read Chad Robertson&rsquo;s cookbook <em>Tartine Bread</em> which documents basically the
opposite process: wild yeast and long, slow rises.</p>

<h2>Wild Yeast</h2>

<p>I decided to just give it a shot; take flour and water mix it up with your
hands and put it in a bowl. After a few days it should start bubbling.
Surprisingly it did. Surprisingly when I ate some it didn&rsquo;t cause me vomit
instantly. I created my own wild yeast starter.</p>

<p>Over the course of about 2 weeks, everyday I would discard around 30% of the
starter and feed it more flour and warm water. It would start bubbling
throughout the day and change in smell from floury, to sweet and milky to
stinky cheese by the next morning.</p>

<h2>Baking Bread: Robertson&rsquo;s Basic Country Loaf</h2>

<p>The first step is creating a leaven. Basically, a bunch of flour and your
starter that is given plenty of time to bubble up and get plenty of carbon
dioxide trapped in it.</p>

<p>I left the flour, water and starter sit overnight but it wasn&rsquo;t ready in the
morning. I put it in my oven with some boiling water to make a proof box and,
again surprisingly, it worked.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7446/12153776365_f795b074a9_b.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7446/12153776365_f795b074a9_b.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Here is the leaven after a few hours in the steamy oven.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/12154155354_3bdfd34bc0_c.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/12154155354_3bdfd34bc0_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be able to float in water, and I think it got close enough.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7314/12154124923_2975ea136b_c.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7314/12154124923_2975ea136b_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the dough with the all the flour and water:</p>

<h3>Bulk Rise</h3>

<p>After that, it was pretty much just waiting and mixing. I did a bulk rise for
three and a half hours, turning the dough every 30 minutes.</p>

<p>As time progresses, you can watch the dough tighten up and get smooth.</p>

<h3>Start</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/12154144803_5f603a17c0_c.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/12154144803_5f603a17c0_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5482/12154597576_e6a2d50034_c.jpg">http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5482/12154597576_e6a2d50034_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s two shots of the dough in the bowl at the start of the bulk rise.</p>

<h3>Hour One</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3827/12155498834_8de5b3832f_c.jpg">http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3827/12155498834_8de5b3832f_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<h3>Hour Three</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7399/12157138386_0637999aef_c.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7399/12157138386_0637999aef_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<h2>Bench Rest</h2>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/12157779113_5f55f3875f_c.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/12157779113_5f55f3875f_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>After the bulk rise, the dough is split in two and plopped on the counter.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/12163496193_d6460dba1e_c.jpg">http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/12163496193_d6460dba1e_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>Surprisingly, it holds its shape pretty well and doesn&rsquo;t just droop everywhere.
It was pretty hard forming the dough into rounds since it is very sticky.</p>

<h2>Final Rise</h2>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/12163914686_a1cc162252_c.jpg">http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/12163914686_a1cc162252_c.jpg</a>"></p>

<p>After about 30 minutes on the counter, the dough rests for another three to
four hours in a nice bowl with a comfy towel.</p>

<h2>500 Degrees in a Dutch Oven</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the crazy oven spring that some people show. Maybe I let it rise
too long or didn&rsquo;t give it rigorous enough turns. Overall, I&rsquo;m more than
satisfied. I ate one of the loafs in the few hours after it came out of the
oven.</p>

<p>I like making bread because its the opposite of what I work on. Its not by the
numbers, you have to be flexible and watch how things develop. No math and no
formulas.</p>

<p>Apologies, some of them are kind of blurry.</p>
