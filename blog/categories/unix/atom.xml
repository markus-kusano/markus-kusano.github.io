    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past three year&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been using Unix as my IDE for mostly C and C++
programming.</p>

<p>The two main components are Vim and ctags.</p>

<p>Vim is a text editor that uses modal hotkeys. It took a bit to learn the basics
but it keeps your fingers on the homerow for which keeps your fingers focused
on typing. There&rsquo;s a lot of somewhat esoteric hotkeys to do stuff like change
the case of a letter that seem kind of worthless, and maybe they are, but it
seems like the ones that come in handy are the ones that stick in your brain
after a while.</p>

<p>Ctags generates a database of function names and definitions found in source
files. You can run it in your project directory and it will generate file
locations of function implementations.</p>

<p>Ctags and Vim integrate together; while in Vim you can press a variety of
hotkeys to open up and jump to the location of a functions definition. This
works great for when you don&rsquo;t understand what is going on.</p>

<p>This leaves you with all the great core Unix tools to analyze, modify or create
additional source code.</p>
