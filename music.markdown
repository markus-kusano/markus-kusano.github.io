## Ambient

### Gas - 0095 (1994)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/gas0095.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Ambient but house at times. Similar to tracks in other ambient albums where the
drums (finally) come in except every track is like that (e.g., _7:39_ from
[76:14](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/76:14>)). The towering synths appearing
out of nothing in the introduction (second track) is reminiscent of the
beginning of [Oxygène](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyg%C3%A8ne>), but here
the composition is much more repetitive. Not to be confused with Wolfgang
Voigt's [Gas](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_(musician)>).

### Higher Intelligence Agency and Biosphere - Polar Sequences (1996)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/polar-sequences.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Like going down a rickety mine elevator power. Cold and metallic with rhythms
slowly forming.

### B12 - Time Tourist (1996)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/b12-time-tourist.jpg">
{:refdef}

Features many tracks with driving percussion (e.g., *Cymetry*) so perhaps
veering somewhat away from ambient. But many tracks, such as the opener
*VOID/COMM* are atmospheric. Overall, this sounds like the moment when the beat
comes back in an ambient album (e.g., *5 23* from Global Communication) except
all the time.

### Datacide - Flowerhead (1995)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/flowerhead.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Slow, low-frequency. Sometimes builds to a muddled
dub-techno sound; like 
[Basic Channel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Channel>) 
with less energy.

### Woob - 1194 (1994)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/woob1194.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Lots of ups and downs, fading between very repetitive synths and drums
(sometimes tribal, sometimes (almost) hip-hop), to field recordings organically
blending with melodies and rhythms. Very forward (perhaps non-ambient) at
times, but also distant at others. Many "world" instruments/vocals I'd know
of if I were smart.

### Ben Woods - Moments (2009)


{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/moments.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}


Washing ambience and minimal piano; different from the "stereotypical" ambient,
perhaps reminiscent of [Tim Hecker](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker>).

### Volt - Through the Rings (2005)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/through-the-rings.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Melodic; 
[berlin school](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_School_of_electronic_music>).
The title and album art are, maybe, the best description.

### Information - Biomekano (2002)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/biomekano.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

### Loscil - Endless Falls (2010)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/endless-falls.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}


## Minimal Electronic

###  Jan Jelinek – Loop-finding-jazz-records 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/loop-finding-jazz.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Pops and clicks and bloops and blips.


## Alternative Rock

### Dream Syndicate - Days of Wine and Roses (1982)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/wine-and-roses.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Sometimes clear, often noisy guitar, repetitive bass, vocals sounding both
melodic and like spoken word.

### House of Love - The Creation Recordings (1988--1986)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/creation-recordings.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

## Shoegaze

### Curve - Doppelgänger (1992)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/doppelganger.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Dense shoegaze guitars, female vocals, and electronic drums.

###  Medicine – Shot Forth Self Living (1991)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/shot-forth-self-living.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

### My Bloody Valentine - Isn't Anything (1988)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/isnt-anything.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Compared to [Loveless](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveless_(album)>): the
guitars are less dense, the vocals more human; but everything is familiar. 

## Post Punk

### The Sound - Jeopardy (1980)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/jeopardy.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Forward and repetitive, almost krauty, bass parts; often distorted sometimes
jangly guitars. Contains the occasional synth and saxophone. 

### Josef K - The Only Fun in Town (1981)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/the-only-fun-in-town.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Jangly guitars, wobbly-pitched vocals. Muffled punky production, sounding,
particularly the vocals, like it's coming through your neighbors wall.
Reminiscent of [The Feelies'](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feelies>)
[Crazy Rhythms](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Rhythms>) without the
crystal-clean guitars.

### Make Up - Save Yourself (1990)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/save-yourself.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

*(Make Me A) Feelin' Man* has a more post-punk sound with upfront distorted
guitars. However, the rest have a more soul/funk sound with electric organs,
and trumpets. You can compare Ian Svenonius' singing to soul but really its a
sound of its own; perhaps in part due to the warm garage-rock style production.

### Magazine - Real Life (1978)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/mag-real-life.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Mix of synths and punky guitars. Vocals reminiscent of Count Chocula.


## Slowcore

### Mazzy Star - So Tonight That I Might See (1993)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/so-tonight.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Folksy, bluesy, (sometimes) noisey, reverby female vocals.

### Pedro the Lion - It's Hard to Find a Friend (1998)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/hard-to-find-a-friend.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Some tracks acoustic, some with a distorted guitar, one percussed by a
metronome. Mix of slow-and-sparse and fast-ish-and-full tracks.

## Twee

### Tiger Trap - Tiger Trap (1995)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/tiger-trap.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Fairly high energy on most tracks. The occasional inflection on vocals adds
(e.g., on *Words and Smiles*) adds to the sentimental lyrics.


### Heavenly - Heavenly vs. Satan (1991)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/heavenly-vs-satan.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Smooth female vocals, jangly/distorted guitar; saccharine lyrics.

## Stoner Rock

### Red Giant - Ultra-Magnetic Glowing Sound (1998)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/ultra-magnetic.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}


## Jazz

### West Montgomery - The Incredible Jazz Guitar of West Montgomery (1960)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/incredible-jazz-guitar.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Very non-abrasive, reminds me of Bossa Nova at times.

## Dub Reggae

### Dubclash - Dubclash (2002)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/dubclash.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Instrumental, minimal, bass heavy.

### Bush Chemists - Light Up Your Spliff (1996)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/lightupyourspliff.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Some vocals, constantly changing effects, and a variety of different
sounds over the tracks.

###  Tommy McCook & The Supersonics – Pleasure Dub (1976)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/pleasure-dub.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

"Vocals" are often a single reverby section of what sounds like a word.

## "Electronic" Dub

###  Mikkel Metal – Close Selections (2005)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/close-selections.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Minimal, almost beatless at times. Uses very atmospheric percussive sounds,
like someone playing ping pong in a cavern, similar to Monolake's 
[Momentum](<http://www.discogs.com/Monolake-Momentum/release/194892>); however,
this is much more laid back, and quirky at times.

## Trip-hop

### Gotan Project - La Revancha del Tango (2001)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/larevancha.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Blends of analog (accordion, guitar, piano) and electronic (mostly drums)
instruments in a trip-hop fashion but far away from, say, 
[Portishead](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portishead_(band)>).

### Nightmares on Wax - In a Space Outta Sound (2006)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/in-space-outta-sound.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Some mostly instrumental tracks, others with vocals. Tempos are low but this
never becomes brooding like, e.g., Portishead. Short segments of the tracks are
minimal, but things progress often and are layered. This, along with the
spattering of vocals, keeps things from sinking into the background.

### Massive Attack - Mezzanine (1998)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/mezzanine.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Dark and almost ambient at times with contributions from reggae artist
[Horace Andy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Andy>).

### DJ Signify - Of Cities (2009)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/ofcities.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Dark, mostly instrumental. The only vocals are Aesop Rock on two tracks. Often
drifts leftfield timbre-wise, e.g., on _Delight to the Sadist_, featuring, at
first, almost droning synths and electronic percussion.

## Downtempo

###  Ulrich Schnauss – A Strangely Isolated Place (2003)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/strangely-isolated.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Shoegaze 
(think [Slowdive](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowdive>)/[My Bloody Valentine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_(band)>)) 
inspired electronic music. It's subtle in that the songs are not
just electronic covers of shoegaze. The influence can be heard in the timbre of
some instruments, e.g., the synth almost sounding like feedback two minutes
into track two; or, in the drums (compare those in the intro to 
[A Letter From Home](<https://youtu.be/i_6Z5C8cE0Q>) to those in the first few 
seconds of My Bloody Valentine's [Soon](<https://youtu.be/LseSx_hPJyQ>)).
Overall, much of the wall-of-sound distortion is replaced with softer synths.

### Kruder & Dorfmeister - The K&D Sessions (1998)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/KandD.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Dubby and blunted. Often repetitive similar to, say, [Endtroducing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endtroducing.....>) but in a
very different style.

## Breakbeat

### Dimensional Holofonic Sound - Attention Earth People (2002)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/earthpeople.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Space themed, technoy at times. Quirky educational spoken-word samples.

###  Djinji Brown - Sirround Sound (2002)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/sirround-sound.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Latin tinged at times, particularly the first four tracks.

## Thug Rap

### Cormega - The Realness (2001)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/the-realness.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

## Drum and Bass

### Amon Tobin -  Permutation (1996)

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="art/permutation.jpg" width="400">
{:refdef}

Still often uses the high-speed drum-and-bass percussion but often with
different instruments than in a typical breakbeat; much more "jazz." Less
energy and darker than, say, 
[Hard Normal Daddy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Normal_Daddy>).
